# PHP Simple MVC Framework
This is a project create to simplify the MVC on PHP. The objective was create a fast way to construct a system, without any giant framework, just with some files.
This is perfect for small projects, like the projects used for configure some hardware.

The usage is simple, you just need to call the MVC class. You can see more on the Example folder.

Enjoy!
