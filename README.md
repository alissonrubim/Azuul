# Azuul MVC - A simple MVC framework for PHP

This is a project create to simplify the MVC on PHP. The objective was create a fast and nice way to construct a system, without any giant framework, just with some files.
This is perfect for small projects and it's perfect to learn MVC.

The usage is simple, you just need to instance a new MVC class, configure some king of things and execute the address. 
You can see more on the Example project.

* API REST Support (json response) - Azuul can be a easy way to create an API REST, just with some code.
